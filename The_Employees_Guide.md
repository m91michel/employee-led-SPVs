# Overview

You can choose how much equity upside you have in your employer.

-   How? Buy it with other people’s money.
    
    -   Raise capital from your network by forming a  [special purpose vehicle (SPV)](https://assure.co/the-anatomy-of-a-capital-raising-spv/). An SPV is a one time use fund that collects capital from investors and makes a single investment.
        
    -   As the SPV’s organizer, you earn a % of the profits in an exit (carry).
        
        -   This can potentially be many multiples of your options/RSUs.
            
        -   You’re only limited by how much allocation (the amount the CEO will let you invest in each round) and investor capital you can gather.
            

How is this different from asking for more  [incentive stock options](https://withcompound.com/g/understanding-equity-compensation)  (ISOs)? A company sets aside ~10% of the total outstanding equity to be common shares that go into an “[option pool](https://www.holloway.com/g/equity-compensation/sections/the-option-pool)”. Options (the right to purchase common stock at a significant discount to preferred stock) are a form of compensation. The rest of the shares are either common shares that founders (or former employees) own or preferred shares that investors own. A good heuristic is that investors buy preferred shares at market price. Employees buy common shares at a heavily discounted price (the strike price of the options).

The number of common shares in the options pool is a hard upper limit on how many shares employees can buy at any given time. Even the most desirable employee can’t buy more common shares than are in the option pool. The company needs board approval to expand the pool. The company uses options to recruit and retain employees so negotiating for more options is almost a zero sum game against current and future employees.

Option grants are an expensive form of dilution to the company. This is because the options let the employee buy shares from the company at a significant discount to what an investor would pay. So if an investor would pay $10 for a share, the company lets the employee buy virtually the same share for $1. This is why companies are very reluctant to give out any more options than absolutely necessary.

In contrast, a company needs to raise a certain amount at a given round. Capital is a commodity. Everyone's money spends the same. The company picks the lead investors for a round and those lead investors will receive board seats. The round’s capital doesn’t all have to come from a lead investor. Often the majority comes from the lead and the rest from existing and new minority investors. This is irrelevant to the company as long as the company gets the desired:

-   Terms (preferred price, liquidation preference, etc.)
    
-   Board members
    
-   Timeline
    
-   Total capital raised
    

For example, the company will have difficulty granting an employee options that let the employee buy 5% of the company through discounted common shares. Even if the employee has joined as a late co-founder or as one of the first 5-10 employees. The company is far more open to the employee buying that level of ownership through preferred shares with cash at market price. This solves three problems for the company:

-   The company gets capital at a market price for its shares
    
-   The employee will act more like a founder.
    
-   The employee is far less likely to voluntarily resign to pursue other opportunities.
    

## Example Scenario

If the company is raising a Series A at a preferred share price of $1 and you raise $200k in commitments:

-   You’ll submit the deal to AngelList to form a Special Purpose Vehicle (a one time use fund)
    
-   The investors will execute subscription docs with AngelList and wire/ACH funds to AngelList’s designated account
    
-   AngelList will sign a purchase agreement with the company on behalf of the SPV and wire $200k to the company
    
-   The SPV now owns preferred shares in the company with a total value of $200k.
    

If the company does not raise another round and then gets bought at a preferred share price of $10, then

-   The SPV capital value is $2m
    
    -   200k shares * $10/share
        
-   The profit to the SPV is $1.8m
    
    -   $2m - $0.2m
        
-   Carried interest to the SPV lead is $360k
    
    -   20% * $1.8m
        

The aggregate carry can skyrocket when you lead SPVs into multple rounds. You earn the sum of all the carried interest generated by each SPV. The carry also scales as a linear function of capital raised. Roughly every $5 you raise from investors for a given round has the same upside as investing $1 of your own personal capital without proportional financial downside.

If you raise a $10m SPV and the company exits at a 2x multiple, then your carried interest is $2m ($20m-$10m = $10m, $10m * 20% = $2m)

These examples are for illustration only and don’t take into account dilution, taxes, fees, etc.

To clarify: there is always the downside risk of the company failing in which case no carry will be earned by the lead and the investors lose their principal.

Here is an  [example financial model](https://youtu.be/w3gcYh1p04w)  (video) you can use to run different scenarios:

# How do we get started?

1.  Please  [schedule a Zoom with me](https://calendly.com/harveymultani)
    
    1.  I will be your concierge and partner as you go through this process.
        
    2.  I’ll also invite you to the Employee Led SPVs Slack group where we can DM.
        
2.  It’s important to do this as early as possible because you can invest in your employer at any time by investing in
    
    1.  A priced round when the company gets a lead investor.
        
    2.  a SAFE in between priced rounds.
        
    3.  Secondaries: buying shares from existing holders like investors, founders, and current/former employees.
        

# What’s my incentive?

1.  I commit to being the first investor in the SPV at $1k.
    
2.  You and I split the carry 50/50 as equal partners on the SPV.
    
    1.  If the SPV is charging the industry standard of 20% carry, then we each earn 10% carry.
        
    2.  For example, If we raise a $10m SPV and the company exits at a 2x multiple, then the total carried interest is $2m ($20m-$10m = $10m, $10m * 20% = $2m)
        
        1.  $1m will go to you
            
        2.  $1m will go to me
            
3.  I will also circulate the deal to my LP network which is interested in investing in employee led SPVs.
    

# Before we start: Get your inbox under control

1.  Your email communication volume will increase dramatically during this process. You might raise millions more if you can efficiently process email. This can become tens of millions of dollars in extra carry.
    
2.  Make sure you can get to  [Inbox Zero](https://blog.superhuman.com/how-leaders-achieve-inbox-zero-2788fe8759bc)  consistently in both your personal and work email inboxes before you proceed to the next steps.
    
    1.  See  [this guide](https://klinger.io/post/71640845938/dont-drown-in-email-how-to-use-gmail-more)  and tools like  [Superhuman](https://superhuman.com/).
        

# Confirm ability to invest with the CEO

**WARNING: ONLY SPEAK WITH THE CEO ABOUT ALLOCATION. DO NOT SPEAK WITH ANYONE ELSE (HIRING MANAGER, COLLEAGUES, ETC.)**

1.  Reasons for only speaking with the CEO
    
    1.  The CEO is generally the only person who can make a decision in this area
        
    2.  Speaking with other employees may lead them to think that you are competing with them. They may also resent because they see this as unfair. There is no rational basis for them to think of this as competition or as unfair. Allocation is not a form of compensation like salary.
        
2.  This next step is the most psychologically difficult but the easiest to execute because VC backed CEOs
    
    1.  likely have multiple SPVs on their cap table
        
    2.  prefer raising capital from someone they already trust.
        

3.  Email your CEO the following:
    
    1.  “Hi <your CEO’s first name>, I’m super bullish on everything we’re doing and I’d like to invest in <your company> using an employee led SPV.
        
        I’m sharing more context below and would love to get your thoughts. I would collaborate with  [Harvey](https://www.linkedin.com/in/harveymultani/)  on the investment if we proceed. If helpful, I can schedule an intro call for the three of us:  
          
        Hi <employee’s first name>, thanks for offering to forward the below to <CEO’s first name>:  
          
        Hi <your CEO’s first name>, great to connect!
        
        My background: one of the first 30 employees at  [Plaid](https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/13/visa-is-acquiring-plaid-for-5-3-billion-2x-its-final-private-valuation/)  and  [Addepar](https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/08/addepar-raises-140-million-so-more-of-the-ultra-rich-can-know-exactly-what-theyre-doing-with-their-money/). Investor in  [People.ai](https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/21/people-ai-the-predictive-sales-startup-raises-60m-at-around-500m-valuation/)  and  [Carta](https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/06/carta-was-just-valued-at-1-7-billion-by-andreessen-horowitz-in-a-deal-some-see-as-rich/)
        
        I now help startup employees earn 10x more equity upside without extra dilution to the company.
        
        I do this by co-leading Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) with employees to purchase primary and secondary shares issued by their employer. The employee earns carried interest like any professional investor. I’ve helped employee’s  [raise >$4m to date](https://harveymultani.substack.com/p/metrics-employee-led-spvs).
        
        The company benefits enormously by boosting retention, strengthening incentive alignment, and receiving capital earlier than usual (minimizing the need for things like venture debt). The  [CEO’s Guide to Employee Led SPVs](https://harveymultani.substack.com/p/the-ceos-guide-to-employee-led-spvs)  describes the benefits in more detail.  
          
        Looking forward to continuing the conversation!  
          
        Thanks!  
        Harvey”
        
4.  If your CEO replies
    
    1.  “Yes”
        
        1.  “How much”
            
            1.  CC me and reply with the below
                
                1.  “Thanks! Let me check with my LPs and I’ll get back to you. Could you share the most recent investor deck?”
                    
        2.  “What terms?”
            
            1.  CC me and reply with the below
                
                1.  “Our preference is primary preferred shares. If a priced round is not currently open, we’re open to an uncapped SAFE at a 20% discount. We’re also open to purchasing secondaries. If you know of any potential sellers, we would appreciate introductions. We’re also happy to source the sellers ourselves if you can confirm in advance that you’re open to approving the transfers.
                    
    2.  “Let’s discuss this live”
        
        1.  Reply with
            
            1.  “Great, I’ll coordinate a time (do this either directly or with your CEO’s executive assistant).  
                  
                I’d also like to loop in  [Harvey Multani](https://www.linkedin.com/in/harveymultani)  (ex Plaid, Coinbase, Addepar, etc.) who I would collaborate with on the investment. He can also talk through more of the details.  
                  
                Will that work for you?”
                
            2.  I’ll work with you to schedule a time that works for everyone.
                
    3.  “No, because <reasons>”
        
        1.  DM me in the Slack group and we’ll craft next steps.
            

# Secondaries: Sourcing Supply

1.  The CEO may say that no primary supply like preferred shares in a priced round or a SAFE in between priced rounds is currently available. If preferred supply is available, skip to the next section.
    
2.  The CEO may be open to the employee led SPV buying shares from existing holders (current employees, ex employees, investors, etc.). This is considered secondary supply.
    
3.  I will ask the CEO
    
    1.  Is there a ceiling on how much $ sale volume the CEO is comfortable with the SPV buying?
        
    2.  Does the CEO know of any current holders that are interested in discussing selling some of their shares?
        
        1.  If so, can the CEO introduce us?
            
        2.  If not, is the CEO okay with us directly approaching ex employees about purchasing their shares?
            
    3.  Who will be involved in approving the transfers?
        
4.  Once we have answers to the above, I will create a contact list of all the possible shareholders we can reach out to
    
5.  I will provide the employee with a reachout script that they will send out with me CCed.
    
    1.  The employee can choose to send the reachout script via a mail merge tool (todo) for batch sending
        
    2.  Subject: <Company name> - Liquidity: <Employee first name> - <Contact full name>  
          
        “Hi <contact first name>,  
          
        I’m interested in buying shares from current holders of <Company name>’s shares.  
          
        I’m currently working at <Company name>. To confirm: this is not a company sponsored initiative of any kind. I have discussed my interest in buying shares from existing holders with <Company’s> leadership but I am acting completely independently in my capacity as an investor. I am also collaborating with Harvey Multani (CCed) on assembling a block of shares to purchase.  
          
        This guide (todo) describes the sales process in more detail.  
          
        Are you interested in learning more about potentially selling some of your shares? I’m happy to share some times that would work for an intro call if you’d like to discuss live.  
          
        Thanks!  
        <Employee’s first name>”
        
6.  Once we receive replies and determine how much initial interest exists, I will send an indication of interest (IOI) form to the interested sellers. The form will ask for
    
    1.  Their stock certificate numbers
        
    2.  Total # of shares they are interested in selling
        
    3.  Whether the shares have been purchased via options exercise or are unexercised
        
7.  After receiving the seller IOIs and calculating volume for sale, we will decide on the share price we are willing to pay
    
    1.  We will run the fundraising flow in the next section in parallel to sourcing supply.
        
8.  I will follow up with the sellers individually regarding our target share price and how much we are willing to buy
    
9.  Once enough sellers agree to the share price and volume via email, I will then send each seller a “[Notice of Intent to Transfer](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u01gDk5lQuEBiUH1pBxInanrIuPcf1nh8RUey8IEu5c/edit?usp=sharing)” to execute. Each “Notice” lists for each buyer:
    
    1.  The seller
        
    2.  The buyer
        
    3.  The sale share price
        
    4.  The # of shares to be sold
        
10.  Once we have all the “Notices”, I will send the notices to the CEO or our designated point of contact at the company. I will request that the company reply via email that they approve the transfers in principle.
    

# Important Context re Fundraising

3.  You’ll encounter investors on a spectrum from relationship driven to financially driven
    
    1.  Relationship investors
        
        1.  You’ll see an initial surge of interest and commits from your true fans (friends, family, former colleagues, etc.)
            
        2.  They are investing because you are leading the investment. They are indifferent to the actual investment, structure, etc.
            
        3.  The bigger you audience/network, the more true fans you’ll have
            
    2.  Financial investors
        
        1.  They evaluate the investment on a purely financial basis
            
        2.  You will likely get much larger commits from this group than you do from your true fans but it will be more work. Learning how to persuade this group is a valuable skill set that compounds.
            
        3.  More likely to be 2nd and 3rd degree connections.
            
        4.  They will ask hard questions and expect thorough answers. Embrace this stress test of your conviction. You may find that it may not make sense to invest or even continue working at the company. This is a good thing for you long term.
            
4.  Fundraising calibration
    
    1.  See  [these metrics](https://harveymultani.substack.com/p/metrics-employee-led-spvs)  on previous employee led SPVs. Expect to
        
        1.  Pitch at least 100 qualified investors
            
        2.  Close 50 investors who sign and wire funds
            
        3.  The average close rate hovers around 50% and tends to improve with more pitches.
            
    2.  This sounds like a lot but not all pitches are meetings.
        
        1.  Some of those pitches will be via email/text so you will get a fast yes or no.
            
        2.  Some may be more involved but shouldn’t be more than one 30m call/Zoom.
            
        3.  Anything more than a 30m call/Zoom should only be for a >$50k commitment
            
    3.  If a potential investor passes, then there is no need to follow up with them for this investment. If someone is not interested, then there is nothing you can do to change their mind. Each SPV investment is unique. Someone who is not interested at this stage may want to invest in a later stage.
        

# Building the deal materials

5.  I will share a deal folder with you that has templates for a
    
    1.  Deal outline
        
        1.  A one page high level description of all the deal terms and relevant information
            
    2.  Deal memo
        
        1.  A detailed deep dive analysis that accompanies the investor deck
            
    3.  Pipeline spreadsheet
        
        1.  A way to track investors and commitments
            
6.  I will begin filling out the deal outline and memo while tagging certain sections with ToDos where I need your input
    

# Investor Qualification and Indicators of Interest

1.  I will provide you with a script similar to the below that is customized for this deal
    
    1.  I will handle deal related questions and will escalate to you for any questions that are company specific and whose answers are not covered in the materials.
        
    2.  “Hey! I’m loving my time at <company name>  
          
        I may have an opportunity to invest in the company and invite a few friends to participate using  [an employee led SPV](https://harveymultani.substack.com/p/the-investors-guide-to-employee-led)
        
        I’m collaborating with  [Harvey Multani](https://www.linkedin.com/in/harveymultani)  (ex Plaid, Coinbase, Addepar, etc.) on this deal. He is also CCed and can help with answering any questions.  
          
        If you’re interested, please  [complete this quick form](http://google.com/)  to affirm your accredited investor status and to access the deal outline.  
          
        Thanks!  
        <Your first name>
        
2.  Reach out to your contacts (CCing me and BCCing each of your contacts) in batches of 10
    
    1.  [TextExpander](https://textexpander.com/)  can help with personalizing and automating your outreach if you’d like to modify the above scripts or use your own.
        
3.  After an investor completes the form, they’ll get access to the one page deal outline
    
4.  The deal outline has a link to another form where investors can submit an Indicator of Interest (IOI)
    
    1.  The IOI asks for the investor’s experience in private investing, decision making process, investing entity, etc.
        
    2.  Asking for this information helps the investor figure out their logistics for deciding and closing the investment.
        

# Sourcing soft commitments

1.  The investor will receive access to the deal folder after completing the IOI. The deal folder will have the deal outline, memo, and the company provided investor deck
    
2.  The deal memo will ask investors to make any comments in-line in the memo.
    
3.  You and I will continually triage any questions/comments that investors leave in the memo until all are covered
    
4.  The memo has a link to a form where an investor can submit a soft commitment.
    

# Finalize allocation with the CEO

3.  Once we have >$100k in soft commits, I will email the CEO CCing you:
    
    1.  “Hi <CEO’s first name>, we have <$xxxk> in commits for the employee led SPV. Can you provide deal docs and confirm who we should coordinate with regarding doc execution and wires?”
        
4.  We can always ask for more allocation if more commits come in later.
    

# Filling the allocation (Primary)

1.  I will privately submit the deal to AngelList with you as a collaborator
    
2.  AngelList will generate a deal specific link. Only people with the link can see the deal
    
3.  I will CC you and email the link to the investors that soft committed.
    
4.  You will follow up with them to execute their commitment and transfer funds.
    
5.  You will continue sourcing new investors. There is no marginal cash cost to bringing in new investors. Raising more capital lowers the expense ratio of the SPV. The expense ratio is the $8k setup fee paid by investors divided by the total amount raised.
    
6.  Follow up every other day with your investors until the AngelList dashboard shows the commitments in the Pipeline spreadsheet are fully funded.
    
7.  After all of your investors have executed their docs and started the funding process, I will share the deal link to my LP network.
    
8.  If we are oversubscribed (investors want to invest more than the allocation you were given by CEO)
    
    1.  I will contact the CEO or whoever our fundraising point of contact is and ask for additional allocation
        
        1.  “Hey X, We’d like to raise our allocation to <total desired additional amount is>, is that feasible?”
            
9.  AngelList will
    
    1.  collect funds from all investors
        
    2.  execute the company’s fundraising docs and wire the capital to the company
        
    3.  Issue both of us carry assignment agreements that confirm our share of the profits if and when the SPV has a successful exit.
        
10.  The company will update its cap table with the SPV’s holdings.
    

# Secondaries: Filling the allocation

1.  The process will look similar to the above except I will establish the SPV with Assure instead of AngelList
    
2.  Assure will execute stock purchase agreements with the sellers and send those agreements to the company
    
3.  Assure will wire funds to the sellers
    
4.  The company will update its cap table to reflect the changes in the sellers’ holdings.
    

# Carry assignment

1.  Carry entity setup
    
    1.  Ask your lawyer if you should have your SPV provider assign the carry to you directly or if you should form an entity (LLC, trust, etc.) to receive the carry

# FAQ

-   What is the operational overhead of the SPV to the employee after the deal has closed?
    
    -   There is virtually no additional work required by the employee. Once the SPV is ready to make distributions at exit, the fund admin will prepare tax docs and handle the distributions.
        
-   When is the optimal time to ask for an allocation?
    
    -   The optimal time to ask for allocation is after you’ve been at the company for at least 3 months. This gives the employee and company a 90 day full time mutual due diligence period.
        
    -   An employee should not ask for allocation if they are planning to leave the company soon.
        
    -   The company may announce a priced round during the first 3 months of the employee’s tenure. It’s up to the employee if they want to run the above process earlier than 3 months in their tenure.
        
-   If top tier investors are pursuing the company, why would it take capital from an employee led SPV?
    
    -   Startups generally spend a large portion of raised capital on salaries. This makes talent retention extremely important for startup founders/executives. The total carry from many employee led SPVs can incentivize the employee to stay at the company longer than they would have if they just received options. Cash compensation may not be as competitive but the prospective carry may more than make up for this. This reduces voluntary turnover after employees pass their 1 year cliff. Employees often start receiving competitive offers from other employers after their cliff.
        
    -   The carry does not vest like options. An employee can raise an SPV and then leave right after the deal closes. But, raising from their network is a strong social incentive to stay at the company. Staying at the company is a compounding benefit because the employee can raise more SPVs.
        
-   Do I need to be an  [accredited investor](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/17/230.501)  to be an advisor (one who receives carry) to an SPV?
    
    -   No, but confirm this with your attorney
        
-   Can the SPV do multiple closings?
    
    -   Yes, for example, the company is raising on a SAFE in between priced rounds
        
        -   The employee led SPV raises $500k, the SPV wires $500k to the company and executes the SAFE for $500k
            
        -   The employee led SPV stays open and raises another $400k, wires it to the company, and executes a $400k SAFE.
            
        -   This should be functionally equivalent to all the SPV raising all the capital up front and executing a $900k SAFE.
            
-   Can the employee invest in the SPV itself?
    
    -   Yes if the employee is an accredited investor.
        
-   What are the tradeoffs of the employee investing in the SPV?
    
    -   The employee can't invest unless the employee qualifies as an accredited investor. Generally SPV leads commit $1k if they are also accredited.
        
-   Can this backfire on an employee in any way? Could asking for allocation and/or filling it with an SPV upset the CEO, other executives, etc.?
    
    -   Anything is possible but it’s hard to imagine a scenario where this occurs.
        
-   Have any CEOs said that an employee asking for allocation is pushy/inappropriate?
    
    -   No. Almost all CEOs who have encountered employee led SPVs have been enthusiastic about employees investing.
        
-   Multiple employees working together
    
    -   Can multiple employees approach the CEO together to ask for an allocation?
        
        -   I don't recommend this. Each employee should separately approach the CEO. They may choose to collaborate on fundraising together later.
            
    -   Does each employee set up their own SPV or can employees use one SPV and share carry?
        
        -   Each employee should lead their own SPV so that there are minimal dependencies.
            
    -   Can SPV leads divide carry in proportion to the amount each co-lead raised?
        
        -   This is a gray area and you should consult with an attorney. Generally you can split carry on other factors (every lead receives equal carry, total allocation sourced, etc.). Sharing carry proportional to how much each lead raised may be broker-dealer territory.
            
-   What do investors think of an employee leading a SPV while selling common shares in a secondary?
    
    -   Shouldn’t be an issue though the employee should disclose this to the SPV investors. It’s up to each investor. An employee is already concentrated in the company through many means (sole salary, options, reputation, SPV carry, etc.). It generally does not alter incentives for the employee to have some liquidity. Check with counsel.
        
-   Can the employee offer different carry terms to different investors
    
    -   Employees should by default reject any attempt to negotiate carry
        
        -   “I don’t have any flexibility on the carry since there is ample demand for the allocation. 20% carry is the industry standard for SPVs.  [This guide](https://assure.co/carried-interest-what-is-common-carry-percentage/) describes common carry schedules across the private funds industry”.
            
    -   If needed, the employee can use a “side-letter” to offer different carry terms for an investor. This letter overrides the SPV’s formation/subscription documents for this specific investor. AngelList can help with this
        
-   What should an employee say if an investor asks for a hurdle?
    
    -   Employees should reject the ask for a hurdle. Hurdles are uncommon in venture investing. The majority of investors in early/growth stage companies invest without a hurdle.
        
-   Can an employee share carry with a co-lead in exchange for help with fundraising?
    
    -   Generally yes, though it’s a gray area to divide carry proportional to capital raised. Speak with an attorney if you’re working with a partner.
        
-   How is carried interest calculated at exit?
    
    -   IPO
        
        -   The SPV administrator calculates the average of the closing prices for the first 5 trading days. That share price will be used as the “exit” price.
            
        -   For example, assume an SPV bought 100 shares at $1/share and the average of the first 5 days of trading’s closing prices is $10/share.
            
            -   The SPV admin will calculate per share profit as $10-$1 = $9/share.
                
            -   $9/share * 100 shares = $900 in profit.
                
            -   $900 in profit * 20% carried interest = $180 in carried interest.
                
            -   $180 / $10/share = 18 shares that the SPV fund admin will transfer to the carry recipients. If dividing the carried interest by the exit price leads to a remainder, then the SPV fund admin will distribute the remainder amount in cash.
                
    -   Secondary sale or acquisition
        
        -   The SPV will take the sale or acquisition price as the exit price and conduct the same calculation as above.
            
        -   The carried interest may be distributed in all cash, shares of the acquirer, or a mix of both.
