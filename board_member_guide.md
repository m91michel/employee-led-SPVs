# Overview

Types of board members at VC backed companies
 - CEO
 - Co-founders (may or may not include CEO)
 - Lead investor of each funding round
 - Independent

Every board member has three core fiduciary duties:
- Care
	 - 
 - Loyalty
	 -
 - Obedience
	 -  

How are board members compensated for these duties and the extra liability they entail?
- CEO/co-founders
	- Common stock holdings
- Lead investors
	- Carried interest and management fees.  The investors' LPs pay these fees.
- Independent directors
	- The company will compensate the independent directors. Sometimes 0.5%-2% equity, which drops as the company grows. The company may sometimes compensate with cash in addition to the equity.

Weâ€™ll ignore independents for now. 

Immediate difference in how cofounders and investors reps are compensated.
