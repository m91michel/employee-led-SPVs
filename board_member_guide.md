# Target Audience

-   Board members
    -   of US based venture capital backed companies who want more equity upside.
-   Everyone: see the  [Master Plan](https://harveymultani.substack.com/p/master-plan-employee-led-spvs)

# Overview

Every board member has three core fiduciary duties:
- Care
	 - 
 - Loyalty
	 -
 - Obedience
	 -  

What are the different types of board members and how are theycompensated for these duties and the extra liability they entail?
- CEO/co-founders
	- Common stock holdings
- Lead investors of each funding found (“investors”)
	- Carried interest and management fees.  The investors' LPs pay these fees.
- Independent directors
	- The company will compensate the independent directors. Sometimes 0.5%-2% equity, which drops as the company grows. The company may sometimes compensate with cash in addition to the equity.

We’ll ignore independents for now. 

Immediate difference in how cofounders and investors are compensated. 

Ownership. Control. Possession. 

What are employee led SPVs and how do they benefit board members?
