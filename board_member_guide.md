# Target Audience

-   Board members
    -   of US based venture capital backed companies who want more equity upside.
-   Everyone: see the  [Master Plan](https://harveymultani.substack.com/p/master-plan-employee-led-spvs)

# Overview

Every board member has two core fiduciary duties:
- Care
	 - Bring focus and attention to acting in the company's best interest
 - Loyalty
	 - Act in the best interest of the company and shareholders

What are the different types of board members and how are they compensated for these duties and the extra liability they entail?
- CEO/co-founders
	- Common stock purchased at founding and follow on grants
- Lead investors of each funding found (“investors”)
	- Carried interest and management fees.  The investors' LPs pay these fees.
- Independent directors
	- The company will compensate the independent directors. Sometimes 0.5%-2% equity, which drops as the company grows. The company may sometimes compensate with cash in addition to the equity.

We’ll ignore independents for now. 

Immediate difference in how cofounders and investors are compensated. 

Ownership. Control. Possession. 

What are employee led SPVs and how do they benefit board members?
