# Overview
Every board member has two core fiduciary duties:
- Care
	 - Bring focus and attention to acting in the company's best interest
 - Loyalty
	 - Act in the best interest of the company and shareholders

Encouraging employee led Special Purpose Vehicles helps board members better fulfill these core duties.

In a healthy organizaay to day decision making will continually be devolved to the employees closest to the customer. 

Encouraging Employee led SPVs ensures that
