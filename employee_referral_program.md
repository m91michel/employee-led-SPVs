# Paid Referral Program: Employee led SPVs
Sourcing startup employees who are willing to lead SPVs into their employers is my highest priority. I am willing to pay to acquire those employees

**From July 14, 2020 to August 15, 2020**, I will split my portion of the total carry with anyone who refers an employee who then goes on to lead an SPV with me. 

For example:

 -  If the SPV is charging the industry standard of 20% carry
	2. The employee earns 10%
	3. The referrer earns 5%
	4. I earn 5%
 -  For example, If we raise a $10m SPV and the company exits at a 2x multiple, then the total carried interest is $2m ($20m-$10m = $10m, $10m * 20% = $2m)
    1.  $1m will go to the employee
    2.  $500k goes to the referrer
    3.  $500k goes to me

Employee criteria:
 - They must be working full time at a US based venture capital backed startup
 - The startup must have raised at least a Series A. Referrals at Pre-Series A companies will be accepted at my discretion.
 - The employee must reasonably intend to be at their employer for at least a year.
 - The referrer and the employee must have read the [Employee's Guide to Employee Led SPVs](https://harveymultani.substack.com/p/startup-employee-syndicates-multiply) before submitting the referral.

Please [complete this form](https://harveymultani902367.typeform.com/to/ZrDo7G08) to submit a referral

## Target companies
- Vercel
- Webflow
- Deepgram
- Modern Treasury
- Particle Health
- Very Good Security

**Notes:** 

 - There may be cases where an employee would like to share carry with additional co-leads beyond just me. In those cases, the referrer and I will split my share 50/50.
