# Paid Referral Program: Employee led SPVs
Sourcing startup employees who are willing to lead SPVs into their employers is my highest priority. I am willing to share carry 

My current compensation structure is a 50/50 carry split with the employee. 
For example:

1.  If the SPV is charging the industry standard of 20% carry, then we each earn 10% carry.
2.  For example, If we raise a $10m SPV and the company exits at a 2x multiple, then the total carried interest is $2m ($20m-$10m = $10m, $10m * 20% = $2m)
    1.  $1m will go to the employee
    2.  $1m will go to me

From July 14, 2020 to August 15, 2020, I am willing to split my half of the carry with anyone who refers an employee who then goes on to lead an SPV. For example:

1.  If the SPV is charging the industry standard of 20% carry
	2. The employee earns 10%
	3. The referrer earns 5%
	4. I earn 5%
2.  For example, If we raise a $10m SPV and the company exits at a 2x multiple, then the total carried interest is $2m ($20m-$10m = $10m, $10m * 20% = $2m)
    1.  $1m will go to the employee
    2.  $500k goes to the referrer
    3.
