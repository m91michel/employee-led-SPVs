# Paid Referral Program: Employee led SPVs
Sourcing startup employees who are willing to lead SPVs into their employers is my highest priority.

My current compensation structure is a 50/50 carry split with the employee. 

For example:

1.  If the SPV is charging the industry standard of 20% carry, then we each earn 10% carry.
    
2.  For example, If we raise a $10m SPV and the company exits at a 2x multiple, then the total carried interest is $2m ($20m-$10m = $10m, $10m * 20% = $2m)
    
    1.  $1m will go to you
        
    2.  $1m will go to me
