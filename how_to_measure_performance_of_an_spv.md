# How to Measure the Performance of an SPV

An SPV is a fund that invests in a single asset. It's financially equivalent to buying that asset. The vast majority of employee led SPVs that invest in VC backed startups accept capital once and then return capital when the company exits.

How do we measure the performance of the SPV? We can use four different metrics to measure the performance of an SPV. Each metric tells us something different and we need all four to get the full picture of the SPV. 

The SPV generally exists in two states: 
- active
	- An active SPV has accepted capital and purchased the underlying asset.
- dissolved
	- A dissolved SPV has exited the asset. The SPV can exit the asset by either selling its shares or by distributing those shares at a terminal value.
