# How to Source Employees for Employee Led SPVs

## What defines a good acquisition channel for employee led SPVs?

The channel should be

## The universe of acquisition channels
 - Channels
	 - Direct
		 - Inbound
			 - Introductions from 1st degree contacts
			 - Newsletter subscribers
		 - Warm outbound
			 - I request introductions to 2nd degree contacts without offering to share carry with the referrer.
				 - This usually results in a few meetings but has not converted to deals in a meaningful way yet. I also used this tactic before I began splitting the carry with the employee. So I would not have had any carry to split with the referrer.
		 - Cold outbound
			 - Email
				 - Strategy
					 - I tried reaching out to every employee at a number of VC backed startups across the spectrum from Series A to pre-IPO. I saw fairly high open rates but did not get many responses. 
				 - Tooling
					 - Prospecting
						 - SalesQL
						 - Apollo
						 - Seamless.ai
					 - Drip campaigns/mail merge
						 - Apollo
						 - Streak
					 - Email sending
						 - Sendgrid
			 - LinkedIn
				 - Connect requests
					 - Employees will generally accept connection requests but they often don't respond when I send a message after the connection request.
				 - Inmails
					 - The response rate is usually around 10%. Some of those responses convert to meetings. Inmails can get expensive since LinkedIn requires a premium plan to send 
				 - Posts that mention employees at a specific company
					 - I have tried two iterations of this so far. In the first iteration, I also tag the CEO but I realized this doesn't make sense since the CEO only needs to be involved in the conversation once an employee is willing to lead an SPV. In the second iteration, I tag employees and see who views my profile. From there, I message the employee. This is operationally taxing since I or a virtual assistant has to manually find and tag each employee in the post.
			 - Twitter
				 - DMs
					 - I've tried this with engineering and product leaders. I have received virtually no responses
				 - Tweets
					 - Mentioning one employee
						 - I haven't tried this yet
					 - Mentioning multiple employees
						  - I haven't tried this yet
	 - Indirect
		 - Referrals
			 - General
				 - Carry share program
			 - Specialist segments
				 - Recruiters
					 - I spoke with a few recruiters about this but haven't heard from them since the initial conversation or message threads.
				 - RIAs/Wealth Managers
					 - May not be able to accept carry for referrals due to regulatory restrictions
				 - CPAs/Accountants
					 - I will investigate if they can receive carry for introductions
				 - Employment lawyers that focus on startup employees
					 - I will investigate if they can receive carry for introductions
