# How to Source Employees for Employee Led SPVs

## What defines a good acquisition channel for employee led SPVs?

The optimal channel should ideally be

 -  Free. Or at worst the cost should be in carry, not upfront cash
 - Scalable. I shouldn't have to manually source or hire someone to manually source each lead
 
## The universe of acquisition channels
### - Direct
####	 - Inbound
######		 - Introductions from 1st degree contacts
		 - Newsletter subscribers
	 - Warm outbound
		 - I requested introductions to 2nd degree contacts without offering to share carry with the referrer.
			 - This usually results in a few meetings but has not converted to deals in a meaningful way yet. I also used this tactic before I began splitting the carry with the employee. So I would not have had any carry to split with the referrer.
###### Newsletter subscribers
I haven't tried anything active here yet beyond the Scout program.
####	 - Cold outbound
#####		 - Email
			 - Strategy
				 - I tried reaching out to every employee at a number of VC backed startups across the spectrum from Series A to pre-IPO. I saw fairly high open rates but did not get many responses. 
			 - Tooling
				 - Prospecting
					 - SalesQL
					 - Apollo
					 - Seamless.ai
				 - Drip campaigns/mail merge
					 - Apollo
					 - Streak
				 - Email sending
					 - Sendgrid
#####		 - LinkedIn
			 - Connection requests
				 - Employees will generally accept connection requests but they often don't respond when I send a message after the connection request.
			 - Inmails
				 - The response rate is usually around 10%. Some of those responses convert to meetings. Inmails can get expensive since LinkedIn requires a premium plan to send then in a meaningful quantity and to also buy more once I hit the send limit. It's also difficult to impossible to get metrics on Inmails like open rates, cohort metrics, etc.
			 - Posts that mention employees at a specific company
				 - I have tried two iterations of this so far. In the first iteration, I also tag the CEO but I realized this doesn't make sense since the CEO only needs to be involved in the conversation once an employee is willing to lead an SPV. In the second iteration, I tag employees and see who views my profile. From there, I message the employee. This is operationally taxing since I or a virtual assistant has to manually find and tag each employee in the post.

#####		 - Twitter
			 - DMs
				 - I've tried this with engineering and product leaders. I have received virtually no responses
			 -  Tweets
				 -  Mentioning one employee
					 -  I haven't tried this yet
				 - Mentioning multiple employees
					  - I haven't tried this yet

### - Indirect
####	 - Press
		 - Podcast interviews
- Newsletter interviews
- Video 		 - Async interviews
		 - YouTuber type interviews
		 - In-person panels/speaking
####	 - Referrals
		 - General
			 - ScoutCarry share program
		 - Specialist segments
			 - Recruiters
				 - I spoke with a few recruiters about this but haven't heard from them since the initial conversation or message threads.
			 - RIAs/Wealth Managers
				 - May not be able to accept carry for referrals due to regulatory restrictions
			 - CPAs/Accountants
				 - I will investigate if they can receive carry for introductions
			 - Employment lawyers that focus on startup employees
				 - I will investigate if they can receive carry for introductions
#### - Paid Advertising
