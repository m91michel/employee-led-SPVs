Am I the right person to spearhead this?

HEXACO profile - Google sheets link

High social confidence/esteem but low sociability. 

Like problem solving and also highly value fast feedback loops. Work on things with the fastest feedback loops possible?

Long feedback loops plus requires interacting with lots of new people. Inherently a relationship business.
